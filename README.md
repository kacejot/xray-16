X-Ray 1.6
==========================

This repository contains X-Ray Engine sources based on version 1.6.02.
The original engine is used in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat game released by GSC Game World.

Main goals of this fork are:
- existing code refactoring to lower newbies entry barrier;
- documenting the engine;
- preservation of compatibility with products that are compatible with the original engine.
